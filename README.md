# Basic Full Stack App with Firestore database

In this assignment the **Next.js** app is extended to display data from a **Google Firestore** database
instead of **JSON** files.
It is written in **Javascript**, uses **React** components,
and includes some styling from **Bootstrap**.
It imagines a boat race taking place in a techno-futuristic wild west, perhaps a gaming universe.
